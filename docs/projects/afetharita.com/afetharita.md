Users can filter this category by location, type of request, and other relevant criteria to find the victims who need assistance.

2. **Help Request:** This category includes relief aid requests such as blankets, tents, and other supplies needed by victims of the disaster. Users can filter this category by location, type of request, and other relevant criteria to find the requests that match their capacity to help.

3. **Services:** This category includes information about services provided in the region to help the people affected by the disaster, such as food serving, hospitals, pharmacies, and other resources. Users can filter this category by location and type of service to find the services they need.

To filter the information in any of the above categories, users can use filter options provided on the Afet Harita homepage. The filtering options are intuitive and user-friendly, allowing users to easily narrow down their search criteria and find the relevant information they need.

### Map Interface

![Map Interface](../../../static/img/map_interface.png)

Afet Harita's map interface is designed to make it easy for users to locate and access information about the disaster and its victims. When users select a filter category and apply their search criteria, the results will appear on the map as specific icons that correspond to the type of information displayed.

To view the detailed information for a particular map pin, users can simply click on the pin. This will open a new drawer on the left side of the screen that displays all the relevant information for that pin. The information may include the location of the disaster victim, the type of help they need, the contact information for the victim or the NGO providing assistance, and any other pertinent details.

The map interface is user-friendly and intuitive, allowing users to easily navigate and interact with the map to find the information they need. The interface also includes zoom and pan functions, allowing users to explore the map in more detail and focus on specific regions or locations.

If you have any questions or issues while using the map interface, please refer to the help section of this user manual for guidance.
